		<h1>About Me</h1>
        <div class="me">
        <h2>I'm Madeleine, it's nice to meet you!</h2>
        <p>I am a sophomore in the School of Information studying UX Design. I am originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, but I love Ann Arbor and all it has to offer. As of now, I hope to graduate in 3 years, achieve a 1-year Masters in Information, and then pursue a career in Product Design or Product Management. I would also love to continue my love for fitness in some way, possibly by becoming a part-time fitness instructor.</p>

		<h2>My Fitness Journey</h2>
		<p>In high school, I swam varsity and played club volleyball. Here at Michigan, I try to uphold a healthy lifestyle. This means eating a balanced diet and exercising 6-7 times/week. My favorite workouts are SoulCycle, swimming, HIIT, and hiking. I compete on the women’s club water polo team, which has been such a great community to be a part of, and I also work for UM Recreational Sports as a lifeguard. I look forward to seeing what I can achieve in the future for both my physical and mental wellbeing.</p>

		  <h2>Summer 2021 Goals</h2>
